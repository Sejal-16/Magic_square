problem statement:print a n row by n column matrix representing numbers from 1 to 9 ..such that the sum of all the rows and columns and diagnols will be n(n^2+1)/2
algorithm:1)sum=n(n^2+1)/2 for every column and row and diagnol when numbers are placed.
2)lets say position of 1 is (n/2,n-1) is (p,q) the next number which is 2 is located at ((p-1),(p-2)) position.
anytime if the calculated position row position becomes -1 then make it (n-1) and if column position becomes n then make it zero.
3)if the calculated position already contains a number then decrement the column by 2 and increment the row by 1.
4)if anytime the row position becomes -1 and column position becomes n switch it to (0,n-2).
